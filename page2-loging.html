    <h1 style="text-align: center;color: blue;"><strong> Style to further heights! Expectations are high for Shohei Ohtani this season.</strong></h1>
     <p>Shohei Otani of the Angels started as a DH against the White Sox on May 31, local time, and contributed to the team's victory by hitting the first multi-home run of the season</p>
    <p>I don't think it's necessary to explain it now, but Ohtani has been pitching for five days since the opening of the season, and has recorded 90 strikeouts so far, ranking first in the league alone.As already reported in this column, if there is no injury and there is no change in the team's appointment policy and he continues to pitch on the 5th, he is moving at a pace exceeding 250 strikeouts, and it is possible to aim for the strikeout title . There is even sex.Until now, Ohtani's dual-wielding style has been compared to Babe Ruth, and "double-digit wins and double-digit homeruns" have been used as indicators. And he has achieved the best feat since Ruth last season.
        , personally, unlike home runs, which can be accumulated by individual power, the number of wins is greatly influenced by the team, so I felt that it was an unsuitable indicator for purely evaluating two-way fighting.
       For a pitcher, the closest thing to a home run is strikeouts, and "the number of home runs + the number of strikeouts" is probably the most appropriate indicator for evaluating a two-sword style.
        [40 home runs and 230 strikeouts, both of which are currently difficult to achieve]</p>
    
    <p>It's a bit off-topic, but one of the things that's garnering attention this season is Braves Ronald Acuna Jr.'s achievement of 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases. Depending on the situation, there is an expectation that he will be the fourth player in MLB history to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases.
        Therefore, in this column, we set a target value unique to Otani as a two-sword fighter, and decided to watch over his performance this season. That is "40 home runs & 230 strikeouts."
        For now, check out the table below. This is a summary of the number of players who have hit 40 home runs and 230 strikeouts in the last 10 seasons (not including 2020, which was a shortened season).</p>
